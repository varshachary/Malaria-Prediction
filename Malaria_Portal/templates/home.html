      <h2>Malaria</h2>
      <p>Malaria is one of the major public health problems in Nigeria. Early prediction of a Malaria outbreak is the key for control of malaria morbidity, mortality as well as reducing the risk of transmission of malaria in the community and can help policymakers, health providers, medical officers, ministry of health and other health organizations to better target medical resources to areas of greatest need.  </p>

      <h2>Adherence</h2>
      <p>Adherence rates decrease as patients stay longer with the condition. Medication non-adherence is thought to be the most common cause of Malaria exacerbation and subsequent hospital readmission in patients with malaria. Because of the importance of medication adherence in managing malaria, a full understanding of the factors associated with medication adherence in patients with malaria is needed so that effective interventions to improve medication adherence can be developed. In Western countries, studies related to application of SVM in cardiovascular patients have been continuously conducted. </p>
